# Times Table Game

## Description
This application is a times tables practice game designed to help users improve their multiplication skills through distraction-free gameplay. The game includes accessibility features such as keyboard-only control, visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers, and a summary screen to track performance.

I have designed this application to help a child with neurodiversity prepare for his year 4 times tables maths assessment. 

I had several constraints to take into consideration: difficulties using the mouse / mouse pad, being distracted by animated features, inability to use apps with any level of sophistication independently, being distracted if using an app on a mobile device.

## Features
- **15 multiplication questions per game using 2 random numbers from 0 to 12**
- **Feedback displayed for each answer**
- **Visual progress tracker**
- **A summary screen** at the end of the game
- **Keyboard-only control** for improved accessibility
